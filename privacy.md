# Privacy Policy for SF Toolkit Extension

The SF Toolkit Extension operates as a browser extension or plugin designed to establish direct communication solely between the user's web browser and Salesforce servers. No data is transmitted to external parties, and no information is retained beyond Salesforce servers once the user navigates away from the SF Toolkit Extension pages. All communication occurs through official Salesforce webservice APIs, functioning on behalf of the logged-in user. Consequently, the SF Toolkit Extension only accesses data and functionalities granted to the user within the Salesforce platform.

Every API call made by the SF Toolkit Extension utilizes the access token/session already in use by the browser to connect with Salesforce. To obtain this access token, the SF Toolkit Extension requires permission to access browser cookie information pertaining to Salesforce domains.

To verify the accuracy of this description, users can inspect the extension's source code, monitor browser network traffic, or rely on the provided assurance.

## Local Storage Policy
